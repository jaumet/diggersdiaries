Welcome to the visualization of the "WWI Diaries" SLNSW collection
by Jaume Nualart, PhD University of Canberra (2017) and University of Barcelona (2016

We present part of the collection "Word War I Diaries" from the State Library of New South Wales (Australia). This site is an interface to that collection developed as part of a research project called Crossreads by Jaume Nualart (PhD Candidate at University of Canberra, Faculty of Arts and Design. 2015).

This project proposes a way of exploring and reading the collection based on grouping pages according to the topics they talk about. The analysis has been done with topic models. We are preparing a publication where the process will be explained in detail.
